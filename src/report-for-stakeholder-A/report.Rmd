# Introduction

In this report we summarise and analyse the vaccination coverage for blue fever and green fever, denoted BF and GF respectively. The analysis was commissioned by WHAT on `r Sys.Date()`.

# Summary

```{r}
df <- readRDS("summary_cov_stat.rds")

df %>%
  mutate(disease = ifelse(disease=="bf", "Blue fever", 
                          ifelse(disease=="gf", "Green fever", NA))) %>%
  rename(Disease = disease, `Minimun coverage`=min_cov,
         `Maximum coverage`=max_cov, 
         `Mean coverage`=mean_cov) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::set_caption("Summary statistics of coverage.")
```

In the table above we summarise the data ranges and mean. We note that `r df$disease[which.max(df$mean_cov)]` has the highest mean coverage.

# Temporal trends

The figure below shows the trends over time. Overall we note a drop in coverage in 2020 and 2021 as well as some stagnation before then. BF had consistently higher coverage than GF.

```{r, fig.cap="Coverage over time by disease. Data is shown in points, trend line is shown with a line and ribbon."}
knitr::include_graphics("coverage.png")
```

# Conclusion

There is a notable drop in coverage for years 2020-2021, it is too soon to say when recovery to pre-disruption levels will be achieved. However, for green fever there was a decline in achieved coverage for the years up to the disruption and the overall coverage for blue fever had stagnated.
