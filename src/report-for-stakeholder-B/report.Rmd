# Introduction

This brief report summarises projections of orange fever vaccination coverage given current trajectories. 

# Methods

We fit a linear model to current estimates of orange fever vaccination coverage andproject until 2025. There are substantial limitations of this approach.

# Results

The figure below illustrates the projections of Orange fever vaccination coverage up to 2025. Our results suggest that 60% coverage could be attained.
