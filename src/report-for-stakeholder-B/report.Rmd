# Introduction

This brief report summarises projections of `r paste0(disname)` vaccination coverage given current trajectories. 

# Methods

We fit a linear model to current estimates of `r paste0(disname)` vaccination coverage andproject until 2025. There are substantial limitations of this approach.

# Results

The figure below illustrates the projections of `r paste0(disname)` vaccination coverage up to 2025. 

```{r fig.cap="Figure: Actual (dots) and projected (line and ribbon) vaccination coverage for paste0(disname)"}
if(dis=="of"){
  knitr::include_graphics("projected_of_2025.png")
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("projected_pf_2025.png")
}
```
